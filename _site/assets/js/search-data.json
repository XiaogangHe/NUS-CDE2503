The first three will focus on data analysis, which will be followed by another three lectures on data visualization. | Lectures will be held live on Zoom and will be recorded. I will also provide additional face-to-face support if you prefer to come to the classroom to attend the lectures. | . Tutorials . | We will have 6 tutorials in total. One tutorial per week. | Tutorials are prepared in Jupyter Notebook format and are fully available online. | We understand that sometimes programming and debugging could be cumbersome. So please come to the computer lab to do tutorials so that the TAs and I can provide hands-on help. | You are welcome to seek help during office hours or through emails. But the best place to get help is the weekly tutorial session. | . Office Hours . | Weekly fixed office hours can be found on the Schedule tab, and will be held either virtually or in-person depending on your needs. | I have an open-door policy.
